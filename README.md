# Stock Market Analysis - Apple Inc.

## Overview:
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Apple Inc. stock prices over the past five years. Through the use of Python programming language and various data analysis libraries, we aim to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of Apple's stock performance.

## Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Stock_Market_ Analysis_Apple_Inc.ipynb.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the EDA process, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, correlation analysis, and outlier detection.

2. **README.md:** Markdown file providing an overview of the project, its objectives, approach, and instructions for running the code.
